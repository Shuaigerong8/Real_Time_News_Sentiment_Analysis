malaysia strives to achieve 100% connectivity by the end of 2025, the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc) is intensifying its efforts to bolster online safety measures. moving into an era defined by rapid 5g and internet of things (iot) expansion, the enhanced connectivity also brings with it advanced occurrences of cyber threats—posing a significant challenge against the escalating tide of cyberbullying, online scams and sexual exploitation. statistics from the royal malaysia police (pdrm) reveal a concerning trend, with 35,368 online crime cases reported in 2024, resulting in losses exceeding rm1.5bil. on top of this, a report by end child prostitution and trafficking (ecpat), unicef and interpol in 2022 revealed as many as 100,000 children are at risk of online sexual exploitation. just last year, pdrm arrested 13 suspects and seized 40,000 pieces of content related to child sexual abuse material. “losses from scams are rising, escalating from hundreds of millions to billions of ringgit, as scammers continuously evolve their methods, including hybrid scams,” said mcmc deputy managing director datuk zurkarnain mohd yasin in an interview. “another concerning factor is online content that touches on the 3rs (race, religion, royalty), which is extremely sensitive, and of course, cyber threats like hacking, data breaches and the spread of fake news.” zurkarnain mentioned that the sophistication of modern scams increasingly exploits the trusting and friendly nature of malaysians, making them vulnerable to such threats. to address these challenges, mcmc is employing a multi-pronged approach involving the government, industry and public, with a primary focus on reinforcing child online safety. regulatory intervention as a regulatory body for the government, mcmc is bolstering its regulatory framework through the online safety bill (onsa) 2024 and licensing requirements for social media providers via the class license for application service providers (casp). “onsa will impute responsibility and accountability on social media providers, ensuring they take proactive measures against harmful content. “this creates a standard of service that adheres with government regulations and addresses the inherent risk on their networks,” said zurkarnain. he said that section 233 of the communications and multimedia act 1998 has also been strengthened, with increased penalties and stricter court rulings for online offences, serving as a deterrent against occurrences of malicious online behaviour. industry collaboration recognising the subjective nature of online content, mcmc actively liaises with social media providers to address harmful online materials and the prevalence of social media-related scams. zurkarnain said that mcmc works closely with social media providers to understand the nuances of posts deemed to be harmful, using its “code of conduct (best practices) for internet messaging and social media service providers” as a guideline. acknowledging that malaysia’s laws and a platform’s terms of use don’t always align, the body works to bridge the gap to ensure that harmful content is addressed effectively while respecting legal boundaries. “content interpretation is not black and white—it varies for each person. so, our role is to provide the context to help social media providers understand the potential harm,” zurkarnain explained. he added that mcmc is also collaborating with social media providers to enable a more efficient process of identifying online suspects with enhanced traceability. public awareness and education a critical approach to mcmc’s strategy is targeted and inclusive awareness campaigns for all community groups. “we need to focus on all sections of the community, including different races, because they face different challenges related to cyber threats. “through this targeted approach, we hope to see reductions in the amount of losses from scams and other cyber threats,” said zurkarnain. mcmc will also collaborate with information department (japen) to disseminate and provide online awareness training for senior citizens, teaching them how to protect themselves and what red flags to look out for. the body has even gone down to schools and public spaces, like ramadan bazaars, to increase awareness of online safety. zurkarnain shared that mcmc has also revamped its public fact-checking systems on the sebenarnya.my website, utilising an artificial intelligence (ai) fact-checking assistant, known as aifa, to empower the public with enhanced fact-checking tools. he added that the public should also take proactive steps to ensure their online safety by practising digital maturity when online. “as a user, the public needs to be aware of the risks and how to protect themselves. they also have a responsibility to conduct themselves appropriately to safeguard online security and the peace of the nation. “while conversations online can become toxic quickly, we don’t have to add fuel to the fire.” for info, visit www.mcmc.gov.my.

engage with entities that have been marked under the alert list as they will not be protected under malaysia’s securities law. caution advised when videos by an influencer or content creator touting investment advice or platform appear on users’ feeds, federation of malaysian consumers association (fomca) ­deputy president datuk paul selvaraj hopes that users will just keep ­scrolling away. “these videos are designed to lure users into potentially fraudulent investment schemes by making unrealistic promises of high profits,” he says. when it comes to investment advice from the likes of financial influencers or content creators, paul says users should be more wary about the possible motives behind such content. — low boon tat/the star paul says fomca has received complaints from consumers who claimed to have been duped into investment schemes promoted by content creators who sometimes style themselves as ‘financial influencers’ or finfluencers. typically, these content creators present themselves as individuals ­living an affluent lifestyle with luxury cars, designer items and huge amounts of cash to flaunt around town on shopping sprees. for users who ask “how can i be like you...”, the creator will tell them to join a trading class or session through telegram, claiming that they’ll see quick returns from their investments. “the people who have lost their money in these schemes come here feeling upset and hope that we can do something to help them get their money back. “but when they have already ­transferred the money out of their account, it’s too late. we can only advise them to make a police report and help them to come to terms with the financial loss,” he says. when it comes to investment advice from the likes of such content ­creators, paul says users should be more wary about possible motives behind such content. “that advice may not be genuine because it’s possible that they have been sponsored (to promote a product or service in the video) or have their own agenda that could lead to ­devastating consequences for investors,” he adds. growing interest the securities commission is ­stepping up to protect investors from potentially fraudulent investment schemes promoted by ­content creators on social media. in july 2024, the sc updated its guidance note on the provision of investment advice to address the growing popularity of financial influencers or finfluencers in promoting capital market products and services. “while finfluencers can help enhance financial literacy, the sc has also seen a rise in the number of cases involving misleading investment ­promotions, scams, and unlicensed activities,” the sc says in a statement to lifestyletech. the sc says it received 4,859 complaints and enquiries on such activities in 2024, a 49% increase from 2023. “these include 77 cases related to unlicensed investment advice – a 250% increase from 22 cases in 2023,” it says. it has also detected 796 urls – compared to 569 in 2023 – linked to possible scams and unlicensed activities, with 84 related to unlicensed investment advice. “these concerns prompted the issuance of the guidance note to help protect investors and promote responsible financial advice,” the sc says, adding that the update is meant to clarify its stance on finfluencers, ensuring that sharing financial insights or advice on social media is treated the same as regulated investment activities under securities laws. investment advice from finfluencers should be treated with an abundance of caution, say experts. — unsplash the five-page guidance note highlights that promoting capital market products such as unit trust funds, cryptocurrencies or trading platforms on social media may require an sc licence, especially if financial insights or recommendations are shared with the expectation of commissions or rewards. it states “generally, talking or sharing factual information about an investment product or towards educating the ­followers (as opposed to advising) would not likely require a licence from the sc”. however, the sc is most likely to consider any sharing as an investment advice if it involves “the provision of recommendation or opinion which may induce your followers or any person who comes across your content to take an action” – for example to buy, sell or hold – regarding those funds. “finfluencers who wish to continue providing investment advice in malaysia are encouraged to obtain an sc licence. they should contact the sc for inquiries on the licensing framework,” it says. serious repercussions finfluencers should take note that engaging in unlicensed regulated activities is an offence which is punishable under the capital markets and services act 2007 (cmsa). any ­person found guilty may be liable to a fine not exceeding rm10mil or imprisonment not exceeding 10 years or both, says the sc. the sc adds that a revised version of its guidelines on advertising for capital market products and related services will come into effect on nov 1. the sc’s five-page guidance note highlights that promoting capital market products such as unit trust funds, cryptocurrencies or trading platforms on social media may require an sc licence, especially if financial insights or recommendations are shared with the expectation of commissions or rewards. — pixabay “the guidelines was revised to update certain requirements and guidance taking into account advertising and promotional trends globally and domestically, including the growing prominence of social media and ­financial influencers (finfluencers),” it says in a march 27 release. finfluencers who voluntarily promote capital market products or services will be treated as advertisers under the guidelines and held accountable for their promotional content. the sc has also tightened requirements for advertisers, making them responsible for ensuring their appointed marketing agents adhere to the guidelines. the 22-page guidelines state that advertisements regarding a capital market product or capital market-­related service must be clear, accurate and balanced in its messaging. it cannot contain any exaggerated messaging that is likely to mislead investors. advertisers must always treat ­investors fairly and not exploit their vulnerabilities, including financial status or lack of expertise. they are also required to disclose hidden fees and charges of the service/product featured, it states. “the guidelines will also impose a prohibition against advertising services in malaysia, of persons who are not authorised by the sc,” it adds in the statement. seeing ‘red flags’ the sc says it has also strengthened its monitoring and surveillance of unlicensed activities on digital platforms. some proactive measures include early intervention to add offenders to its investor alert list and initiatives to get potentially ­fraudulent websites and social media accounts blocked, where the efforts are “carried out in close collaboration with malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc)”. it also takes enforcement action when necessary. “notably, the sc issued ­reprimands to five unlicensed investment ­advisors, pursuant to section 354(3) of the capital market services act, resulting in rm9,140,000 in penalties between 2022 and 2023,” it adds. paul says fomca has received complaints from consumers

scam and unlicensed activities through public feedback from its aduan channel. investors are urged to spot possible scams through its t.i.p.u. ­formula where t stands for “tidak akan rugi” (guaranteed no losses), i for “indah khabar dari rupa” (too good to be true), p for “peluang hanya sekali” (limited-time offers), and u for “untung besar” (unrealistically high returns). “other scam tactics include promotions via social media ads, redirection to whatsapp/telegram, fake regulatory documents, and the use of company mule bank accounts to disguise illicit activities. “recent trends include deepfake videos impersonating public figures and pre-ipo scams,” it adds. the sc also encourages investors to verify entities through the investsmart portal and only deal with licensed ­professionals. however, paul says people may shy away from professionals due to ­concerns about the cost. “in my opinion, registered financial advisers are completely underutilised. they need to be upfront about the cost (to engage them) and make it easier for people to reach out. however, ­people don’t go to them simply because they don’t know how much it’s going to cost them,” he adds. treating financial illiteracy according to dr adam zubir, the minimum cost of engaging the service of a licensed financial planner may be around rm5,000. as someone who has undergone training and certification courses to become a licensed financial planner, dr adam is aware of the dos and don’ts when it comes to advising his clients on investments. before anyone starts investing into any scheme they may have seen on social media, dr adam says to please check whether the entity or individual is registered with the sc first. — dr adam zubir “for example, i won’t tell someone to transfer money to my personal account for investment purposes. i also can’t say invest rm500 now to get rm10,000 in return. that’s a scam! i can offer financial advice but it has to be after i’ve carefully studied the market condition. “i will advise them on how to diversify their investment portfolio and also remind them of the possible risks at the same time. they have to make the decision on their own,” he says when contacted by lifestyletech. he admits that most people are reluctant to seek the services of a licensed financial planner due to the cost, and that most may also have misconceptions about their role assuming they are insurance agents instead. “they don’t want to pay to seek professional help which is why they’d rather take advice or tips found on social media or family members. i would encourage people to spend money learning how to manage their finances from a professional so they can protect their wealth,” he adds. dr adam was a medical doctor in the uk before coming back to malaysia to start a career in financial planning. now, he styles himself as doktor kewangan on social media, where his channel on tiktok has amassed over 370,000 followers. “basically, i want to treat financial illiteracy. i’ve seen what happens when people manage their finances badly from my personal experience. it has also been frustrating to see people continuously fall for investment scams promoted by some individuals on social media,” he says. before anyone starts investing in any scheme they may have seen on social media, dr adam says to please check whether the entity or individual is registered with the sc first. “you should also see if they have been listed in the investor alert list. secondly: never transfer investment funds into a personal bank account. it could be a mule account. lastly, please learn about investments first – the risks, rewards and why nothing in this world can turn rm500 into rm10,000 in a short amount of time,” he says.

regulate social media platforms through licensing is a step in the right direction, but child safety advocates say regulation alone is not enough. they warn that without strict oversight and complementary measures like stronger parental involvement and digital literacy programmes, children may still be vulnerable to online risks. unicef malaysia child protection specialist sivaselvi supramaniam said regulating through licensing or otherwise is not by itself enough to ensure comprehensive child protection. “we must ensure that strong child safety protection is built into the digital environment from the start. “regulations must also enforce clear standards for child safety. this means requiring industries, including social media platforms, to proactively detect, remove, block and report child sexual abuse materials,” she said. debate on the issue was recently ignited when australia, on nov 28 last year, passed a law banning social media access for children under 16. this regulation requires platforms like instagram, facebook and tiktok to prevent minors from logging in or face fines of up to a$49.5mil (rm138mil). though the malaysian government does not intend to implement the same measures as australia, it started monitoring social media platforms from jan 1 this year (see infographic) to ensure that age restriction regulations are being enforced effectively through its regulatory framework. x (formerly twitter), tiktok, facebook, instagram and whatsapp require users to be at least 13 years old, while telegram has set its age limit at 16. this framework (see infographic) requires platforms with at least eight million registered users to obtain an application service provider (asp) class licence under the communications and multimedia act 1998. the licensing requirement, according to the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc), aims to enhance online safety, protect users and strengthen regulation of internet messaging and social media service providers. sivaselvi said the effectiveness of regulating social media use among children through licensing also depends on consistent monitoring and enforcement to hold service providers accountable. “additionally, a broader, multifaceted approach is necessary –one that involves collaboration among parents, educators, children, and between the government and industry to create a stronger safety net,” she said. noor azimah parents must step up although licensing social media platforms is a significant step, parents must also play an active role in ensuring their children’s safety online, said parent action group for education (page) chairman datin noor azimah abdul rahim. one of the main concerns raised, she said, is that children may find ways to bypass age restrictions, making parental involvement crucial. “tech giants could get the help of parents to verify age to ensure that content is either age-appropriate or not at all,” she said, adding that parental controls such as screen time limits, restricted access to certain content, and real-time monitoring of online interactions are essential tools in this effort. echoing this, sivaselvi emphasised the importance of parental involvement and urged parents to be more engaged in their children’s digital lives. “educators, parents and caregivers should remain vigilant for any warning signs, seek expert help when needed, and assist children in accessing the appropriate services,” she said. as digital threats constantly evolve, parents may struggle to keep up with new risks related to cyberbullying, online grooming and inappropriate content, said noor azimah. “parents must take an active role by setting boundaries on device usage, engaging in meaningful conversations about online responsibility, and fostering trust with their children,” she said, adding that this means having open discussions about the dangers of the internet, setting clear expectations for behaviour, and educating children on safe digital practices. digital literacy educating children on safe internet usage, privacy protection, and recognising online threats can help them navigate the digital space responsibly, sivaselvi asserted. she pointed out that globally, advances in digital technology have had a positive impact on children’s lives, with the potential to significantly contribute to the realisation of children’s rights under the convention on the rights of the child (crc), including the right to express their views (article 12), freedom of expression (article 13), information (article 17), education (article 28), and participation in artistic and cultural activities (article 31). “however, children today are at risk of identity theft, violations of personal data and privacy, harassment, radicalisation, and sexual exploitation,” she said. given that an estimated 100,000 malaysian children aged 12 to 17 have experienced online child sexual exploitation and abuse (ocsea), the urgency for stricter regulatory measures cannot be overstated, she added. “this alarming statistic demonstrates that regulatory measures must be paired with education, parental engagement and stronger industry accountability,” she said. highlighting the importance of equipping children with digital literacy and comprehensive sexuality education (cse), sivaselvi emphasised that educators, parents caregivers and industry professionals should be equipped with the tools and knowledge to understand and address the potential mental health implications of ocsea. “cse helps children recognise risks, set personal boundaries and respond to inappropriate behaviour, while digital literacy programmes empower them to navigate online spaces safely. “social media influencers should also be engaged to promote evidence-based mental health and psychosocial support information,” she explained. meanwhile, noor azimah emphasised the importance of awareness campaigns to educate both children and parents. “awareness campaigns are crucial to get the attention of schools and parents, especially through mainstream media,” she said, adding that social media can help spread information about digital safety and responsible internet usage. “some parents may not be tech-savvy enough to monitor their children, making it crucial for awareness campaigns to provide them with the necessary knowledge and tools to help them educate their kids to navigate online risks effectively,” she explained. sivaselvi said public awareness campaigns must focus on the dangers of ocsea. “the government should lead programmes that teach children about consent, personal boundaries, recognising inappropriate behaviour, and the risks and responsibilities associated with creating and sharing sexual images,” she stressed. additionally, she advocated for helplines and hotlines to be strengthened, ensuring that children and young people affected by online exploitation can seek specialised assistance. “protecting children online is not just the responsibility of industry or governments – it’s a shared duty. “by working together, we can make malaysia’s digital landscape safer for every child,” she said. collective responsibility as messaging and social media services become increasingly integrated into children’s lives, sivaselvi said digital service providers too bear significant responsibility in shaping the content that children access and share. “these companies hold vast amounts of data on young users, which can be used either to enhance their safety or, if mismanaged, expose them to risks,” she said. citing the international telecommunications union guidelines for industry on child online protection (2020), the 5rights foundation’s child online safety toolkit, and the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee) standard for an age-appropriate digital services framework based on the 5rights principles for children (ieee std 2089-2021), she recommended that digital service providers adopt a range of tools and safety features to create a more secure online environment for children. these guidelines, she said, call on platforms to offer differentiated accounts for children, ensuring that age-appropriate content and interactions are maintained. “search engines, social media platforms, gaming services and other digital spaces commonly accessed by children should include developmentally appropriate modes that filter out harmful content. “to prioritise child safety, platforms should set the most secure privacy and safety levels by default,” she said, adding that this includes making visibility settings private, disabling geolocation, and limiting engagement-driven features like auto-play, push notifications, and random reward systems that encourage prolonged screen time. platforms, she said, must also ensure that profiling and recommender algorithms do not expose children to harmful content, providing transparency about how these systems work and the data used in decision-making. “additionally, digital service providers must present their terms and conditions in a format that is easily understood by children. “mechanisms should be in place for young users and their parents to report inappropriate content, breaches of platform rules, or online abuse,” she added. on parental controls, she said it should be both intuitive and effective, allowing parents to monitor their children’s screen time, interactions, and the type of content they are exposed to. “however, these controls must also respect children’s evolving digital independence and privacy. “clear guidance should accompany these tools to help parents understand their capabilities and limitations. “with respect to age verification, online service providers need to implement appropriate and proportionate age assurance measures, using methods that are consistent with the principle of data minimisation and children’s right to privacy,” she said, adding that by implementing these measures, digital service providers can play a more proactive role in safeguarding children online. noor azimah also highlighted the need for an independent watchdog that is clear in its objectives and not beholden to any party, ensuring that malaysia’s social media licensing efforts are effective and enforceable. without independent oversight, she warned, regulatory efforts risk being inconsistent. “this reinforces the idea that regulating social media requires a collective effort – not just from the government, but also from independent bodies, industry stakeholders, parents and educators working together to uphold digital safety standards,” she concluded. march  network service providers to provide parental control tools

artificial intelligence (ai) to create pornographic images of his schoolmates and school alumni. johor police chief comm datuk m. kumar said the cops had received eight reports against the teenager, who was arrested at 5pm on tuesday (april 8) in kulai. “we have also seized a phone believed to have been used to edit and upload lewd photos of his victims on social media, which are then sold at rm2 each. “early investigation found that the suspect used ai to edit photos of his victims, which he obtained through social media,” he said in a statement on wednesday (april 9). he said the suspect is being remanded for four days from wednesday (april 9) to assist in investigations. “we urge other victims to come forward and lodge a report at their nearest police station. “we would also like to remind the public not to share photos of the victims on social media,” he said, adding that those with information on the case could contact insp nurul huda shohodin at 013-5382698. the case is being investigated under section 292 of the penal code for the sale, distribution, or circulation of obscene materials and section 233 of the communications and multimedia act for sharing offensive and inappropriate content. meanwhile, deputy digital minister teo nie ching said 30 to 40 of the student’s schoolmates and his school’s alumni were believed to have become victims of his ai-generated images. “a majority of them are the school’s alumni. however, there are also current students as young as 14 years old. “it is possible that some victims are still unaware that their images have been maliciously manipulated and distributed. “we learned that multiple groups using the name ‘foon yew’ have emerged on social media platforms. “these groups have been circulating obscene photos generated using deepfake technology,\" she said in a statement on wednesday (april 9). teo, who is also kulai mp, added that she has told the malaysian communications and multimedia commission to work closely with the police to expedite the investigation process. “in the meantime, i want to say this to all the victims – this is not your fault. what happened to you could have happened to anyone,” she said, adding that victims who have yet to lodge police reports can reach out to her office for assistance, including legal advice and emotional support. it was earlier reported that a private secondary school student here is alleged to have used ai to create sexually explicit images of his schoolmates.

intelligence (ai) to create pornographic images of his schoolmates and school alumni. johor police chief comm datuk m. kumar said the police received eight reports against the teenager, who was arrested at 5pm on tuesday in kulai. “we have also seized a phone believed to have been used to edit and upload lewd photos of his victims on social media, which are then sold at rm2 each. “early investigation found that the suspect used ai to edit photos of his victims, which he obtained through social media,” he said in a statement. he said the suspect is being remanded for four days until april 12 to assist in investigations. “we urge other victims to come forward and lodge a report at their nearest police station. “we would also remind the public not to share photos of the victims on social media,” he said. those with information on the case can contact insp nurul huda shohodin at 013-5382698. the case is being investigated under section 292 of the penal code for the sale, distribution, or circulation of obscene materials and section 233 of the communications and multimedia act for sharing offensive and inappropriate content. meanwhile, deputy communi­cations minister teo nie ching said 30 to 40 of the student’s schoolmates and alumni were believed to have become victims of his ai-generated images. “majority of them are the school’s alumni. there are also current students as young as 14 years old. it is possible that some victims are still unaware that their images have been maliciously manipulated and distributed. “we learned that multiple groups using the name ‘foon yew’ have emerged on social media platforms. “these groups have been circulating obscene photos generated using deepfake technology,” she said in a statement. teo, who is also kulai mp, has told the malaysian communica­tions and multimedia commission to work closely with the police to expedite the investigation process.

from the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc) to roll out the country’s second 5g network. the award paves way for the orange telco to deploy its own next gen 5g network. the letter of award comes after the u mobile was named as the winner of the second 5g network bid on 1st november 2024, while digital nasional berhad’s (dnb) status as a single wholesale network was revoked on 31st december 2024. in a statement, u mobile applaud the government’s vision of implementing the 5g dual network model, enhancing the industry’s sustainability while promoting competition and innovation, ensuring malaysia remains at the forefront of technological advancement. the telco has expressed confidence in its ability to deliver a state-of-the-art next generation 5g network for malaysia backed by its solid track record spanning over 17 years. it added that its commitment to excellence and innovation will ensure a superior 5g and 5g-advanced experience for all malaysians. commenting on the latest development, u mobile ceo wong heang tuck said, “u mobile is honoured to receive the confidence from the malaysian government and mcmc to implement malaysia’s newest 5g network. with this mandate, u mobile looks forward to playing a more critical role in realising the government’s ambitions to make malaysia a regional leader in the digital economy by delivering a superior experience through our enterprise-grade next gen 5g network.” he added, “we are committed to supporting the nation’s digital transformation by driving 5g adoption, supporting malaysia’s aim of becoming a high-income digital nation.” while the award marks a step forward in the country’s transition to a 5g dual network model, the mcmc and the government has yet to reveal deployment targets of the second 5g network. u mobile is currently still a shareholder and an access seeker with dnb, and they are required to divest their interest before they can rollout its own 5g network. digital minister gobind singh told parliament in november last year that the government must be reimbursed for its funding in dnb as part of the requirements to transition from a single wholesale network to a dual network model.

director-general datuk dr sirajuddin suhaimee said jakim's corporate communication unit representatives filed the report at the putrajaya police headquarters at about 8.30am on friday (march 21). \"some posts contained elements of insult towards islam, the quran and prophet muhammad, causing unease, especially among muslims. \"we are leaving it to the police and the malaysian communications and multimedia commission to investigate and take necessary action,\" he told reporters at a breaking of fast event held in conjunction with the madani adopted village programme at al-munariah mosque, kampung menora on friday. on march 16, minister in the prime minister's department (religious affairs) datuk dr mohd na'im mokhtar said any form of insult against religion, particularly islam, must not be tolerated and firm action should be taken to preserve national harmony. sirajuddin further said that jakim reminded muslims not to retaliate to insults against islam as it would only prolong the issue. he added that the jakim remains open to discussions with non-muslims on matters that could affect racial and religious harmony in the country. – bernama

|\n","|kuala lumpur: a civil servant was among four people detained for possession and distribution of 50,000 child sexual abuse materials in an international police operation. deputy inspector-general of police datuk seri ayob khan mydin pitchay said the other three were an accountant, a web designer and a telecommunications company trainer. the suspects are aged between 26 and 49. they were detained in a joint operation involving six countries and headed by a team of police from singapore in ampang jaya, kajang and shah alam in selangor, and penang. the other countries involved were thailand, japan, south korea and china (hong kong). the operation took place between feb 24 and march 28. \"in total, 435 individuals were detained under the suspicion of distributing child sexual abuse materials,\" ayob khan told reporters during a press conference on the cyber guardian operation at bukit aman yesterday. \"their modus operandi was to use electronic devices to access, store and distribute these materials via online, including using the telegram app,\" he said. all suspects are being investigated under the child act and the sexual offences against children act. so far, four investigation papers have been opened and two cases have been brought to court. separately, bukit aman criminal investigation depart­ment director comm datuk seri mohd shuhaily mohd zain told reporters that two of the three investigation papers initiated following the altercation between a balloon vendor and kuala lumpur city hall (dbkl) officers in jalan tuanku abdul rahman have been referred to the attorney general's chambers. the investigation papers are under sections 186 and 325 of the penal code for obstructing a public officer in the discharge of their duties and causing grievous bodily harm. \"we are still waiting for feedback from the mcmc (malaysian communications and multimedia commission) regarding a website linked to the investigation under section 506 of the penal code for criminal intimidation,\" he was quoted as saying by bernama. comm mohd shuhaily urged the public to remain level-headed and not be influenced by emotionally charged issues. he advised them to act with maturity, adhere to the law and work together to uphold national harmony. meanwhile, sources revealed that the balloon vendor, known as \"abang belon\" by netizens, has 13 prior cases, mostly related to narcotics. \"the suspect has been charged in connection with six of these cases,\" a source said. on march 28, chaos ensued in jalan tuanku abdul rahman here when a raid by the dbkl enforcement team on an unlicensed vendor escalated into a fight. kuala lumpur deputy police chief deputy comm datuk azry akmar ayob previously confirmed that three reports had been filed regarding the incident. the first was lodged by a dbkl enforcement officer for obstructing a civil servant from discharging their duties. the second report was filed by another dbkl officer regarding the circulation of his image on facebook, along with accompanying threatening statements, while the third was made by balloon vendor muhammad zaimuddin azlan's mother.

would be channelled through the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc). of the total fund, rm150mil had been approved earlier. “i have a niece who is studying at universiti teknologi mara deng­kil. “when i visited the campus, i noticed that every room had its own wifi router. “this is a good standard that could be adopted by other institutions. “i have since requested that we allocate an additional rm50mil, bringing the total to rm200mil, to resolve the internet issues at mara educational institutions,” he said during a hari raya aidilfitri event at universiti poly-tech malaysia (uptm) here yesterday. fahmi said that improved internet accessibility must be aligned with user awareness, urging students not to misuse the facility, get involved in crime or spread slander. “i hope mara can work together with the ministry and mcmc to promote safe internet connectivity,” he added. in january, fahmi said his ministry, through mcmc, was set to invest over rm600mil to improve wifi access at all public universities across the country. this project is expected to be completed by year-end, he added. yesterday’s event also saw a memorandum of understanding (mou) inked between mcmc and mara to improve the internet connectivity. the mou would involve maktab rendah sains mara, institut kema­hiran mara, kolej kema­hi­ran tinggi mara, mara-japan indus­trial institute, kolej poly-tech mara, kolej profesional mara, kolej mara, universiti kuala lumpur, german-malaysia institute and giatmara. this initiative will facilitate learning and enable students to make use of internet access for their daily needs. the mou also involves the safe internet campaign to develop awareness among students and staff. earlier, deputy prime minister datuk seri dr ahmad zahid hamidi said in his opening speech that a proposal to expand uptm campus had been agreed upon. the proposal, he said, would be presented to the cabinet next week as part of the efforts to support uptm’s growth, which conti­nues to see increasing demand for its academic programmes. “there is a pressing need to expand the campus, given the encou­raging response to the cour­ses offered at uptm. “with demand on the rise, it is crucial that the university is equipped with a larger facility,” said ahmad zahid.

conflicted. we are working hard to solve internet issues to ensure it is fast and affordable but if some people misuse it for criminal activity or to spread slander, i don’t want this high-speed, quality internet service to be misused. \"i hope mara can work together with the ministry and mcmc to promote safe internet,\" he added. on january, fahmi said his ministry, through mcmc, was set to

|\n","|kuala lumpur: bukit aman has proposed the introduction of 139 permanent posts to the national scam response centre (nsrc). bukit aman commercial crime investigation department (ccid) director comm datuk seri ramli mohamed yoosuf said the propo­sal is part of the ongoing structu­ring of nsrc. “the permanent posts are needed to strengthen nsrc, including extending its operation period to 24 hours. nsrc will also have a new headquarters provided by the malaysian communications and multimedia commission,” he told reporters at the ccid headquarters yesterday. “the restructuring will also see the police lead the operational aspect of nsrc. “a senior police officer with the rank of senior asst comm will lead the nsrc team,” he added. comm ramli said nsrc was esta­blished in 2022 as an operational centre to coordinate rapid response to online financial fraud. “this response includes faster detection of stolen funds and enforcement action against criminals. its role is becoming more significant and in line with other countries in the region, which also introduced similar centres, such as the anti-online centre in bangkok, thailand, and the anti-scam centre in singapore,” he said. as of dec 31 last year, nsrc had handled 161,863 calls from scam victims and those who wanted scam-related advice and information, comm ramli said. “a total of 72,523 bank accounts have been earmarked for suspected involvement in scams. it invol­ved rm50.8mil,” he said. meanwhile, in another case, five men and two women were detained following a raid on march 13 on a condominium used as a scam call centre in cyberjaya. comm ramli said the suspects, who were all locals, were running a job scam, targeting victims from hong kong.

minister datuk fahmi fadzil has reminded all parties not to exploit the issue of the relocation of a temple on jalan masjid india here for personal or political gain. he urged those not directly involved to allow space for the relevant parties to resolve the matter peacefully and to refrain from taking actions that go beyond the boundaries of the law. fahmi, who is also the member of

(dbkl), which is facilitating the relocation and the provision of an alternative site. \"there have been extensive discussions among them. therefore, those of us on the outside should give them space to continue their negotiations, as requested by prime minister datuk seri anwar ibrahim. \"the temple management had previously expressed their views and made requests regarding alternative locations. this matter has been and is being managed by dbkl and other parties to ensure harmony and prevent any misunderstandings, as jakel also wishes for this process to proceed peacefully and smoothly,” he said. he told this to reporters after attending an iftar and aidilfitri assistance distribution event for lembah pantai residents here today. fahmi also reminded all parties to avoid posting offensive comments on social media. \"the royal malaysia police (pdrm) and the malaysian communications and multimedia commission (mcmc) are continuously monitoring the situation, and if anyone is found to have violated the law, strict action will be taken against them,” he said. earlier, he presented aidilfitri assistance to 30 family representatives attending the event. some 1,100 families received aid of rm150 per family from the lembah pantai member of parliament’s office. on thursday, the media reported that discussions on the relocation of the dewi sri pathrakaliamman temple, which is situated on land owned by jakel group, were progressing harmoniously between the company, the temple management, and dbkl. kuala lumpur mayor datuk seri dr maimunah mohd sharif was reported as saying that dbkl is
